        <p>Meditation is a practice that involves training your mind to focus and redirect thoughts. 
            It can be done through various<br>techniques like mindfulness, breathing exercises, or guided imagery. 
            The benefits of meditation include reduced stress,<br> improved concentration, enhanced self-awareness, 
            increased emotional well-being, and a greater sense of inner <br>peace and happiness. Regular meditation 
            can also promote better sleep, lower blood pressure, and cultivate a deeper<br>connection with oneself and others.</p>

        <h2>Meditation is a skill</h2>
        <p>Mastering to meditate is similar to mastering any other skill. Consider training a muscle that you've never worked out<br>
            before. It needs regular practice to get comfortable. And having an instructor typically makes things simpler. We have<br>
            you covered there.

                <h3>What is meditation?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Meditation is not about becoming a different, new, or better person. It is about increasing awareness and developing a
                        healthy attitude. You are not attempting to turn off your thoughts or sensations. You're learning to watch them without
                        passing judgment. You may gradually come to understand them better.</p>

                <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Mindfulness is the ability to be present, to rest in the here and now, completely involved in whatever we are doing at the time.</p>

                <h3>What's the best time to meditate?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>We recommend that you meditate first thing in the morning. It's a great way to start the day and typically the most convenient time to find a few uninterrupted minutes. The most essential thing is to choose a time that works for you and attempt to meditate regularly at that time.</p>

                <h3>Where should I meditate?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>No need to hike to the nearest mountaintop. Any reasonably quiet, comfortable place where you’re not likely to be interrupted is just fine.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>You can wear whatever you like so long as you’re comfortable. It also helps to take off uncomfortable shoes and to loosen tight clothing, like ties or belts, if they’re bothering you.</p>

                <h3>How should I sit during meditation?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Sit in the middle of a chair with your legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor and hands resting on the legs or on your lap. The important thing is to set your body up in a way that your muscles are able to switch off and relax.</p>

                <h3>Can I meditate lying down?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>We generally recommend sitting instead of lying down. However, if it’s too painful or uncomfortable to sit upright, you’re OK lying down. Try placing a thin pillow under your head and bending your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. It’ll help protect your lower back.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Not at all. When we meditate, we’re not trying to breathe in a special way. Just allow the breath to be completely natural.</p>

                <h3>How do I start meditating again after a break?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>It really depends on how long you’ve been away. If it’s only been a few days, just pick up right where you left off. If it’s been at least a week, we recommend restarting the pack. If it’s been more than a month, you should probably do the Basics pack and get comfortable meditating again before you jump into anything else.</p>
